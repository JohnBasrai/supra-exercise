## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2025-06-23

### Added
- Initial implementation of async query processing pipeline
- EMBP (Explicit Module Boundary Pattern) architecture with gateway modules
- API abstraction layer with `ApiCaller` trait
- Stream ingestion module for processing query streams
- Async processor with caching and deduplication
- Comprehensive unit tests with mock API implementation
- Integration tests for end-to-end pipeline validation

- **Comprehensive Testing**: Both unit tests (with mocks) and integration tests
- **Production Ready**: Professional code organization and documentation

### Technical Details
- Rust 2021 edition
- Tokio async runtime with time, sync, and macros features
